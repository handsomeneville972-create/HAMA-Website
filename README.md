# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hama.git
cd hama

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Supabase project credentials
```

### Environment Variables

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
npm test
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema

Migrations are in `supabase/migrations/` and should be applied in order:

| `20240620000002` | Data tables — properties, products, services, etc. |
| `20240620000003` | Seed data for development |
| `20240620000004` | Early access features — waitlist, referrals, email |
| `20240620000005` | Feature request portal |

## 🔐 Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled on all tables
- Supabase policies restrict data access per user role
- Service role key is never exposed to the client
